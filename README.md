## Drawing tanks from a bag...

You have a bag of N tanks. You do not know how many tanks there are, but you know that they are labeled from 1,...,N. You draw tanks without replacement and try to figure out an value for N. 

Running `python main.py` and give you the below figure. Here the true value was N=300 and you were drawing 6 tanks.
